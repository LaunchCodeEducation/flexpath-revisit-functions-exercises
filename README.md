## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

## Testing / Verification

Include relevant details here about where solution files are stored

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Function Declarations and Expressions**:
    
    - How to define functions using declarations and expressions.
    - Differences between the two, including hoisting behavior.
2. **Arrow Functions**:
    
    - Syntax and differences from traditional function expressions.
    - Limitations of arrow functions, like the lack of `this` binding.
3. **Function Constructor**:
    
    - Using the `Function` constructor to create functions dynamically.
4. **Recursion**:
    
    - Understanding recursive functions and the importance of base cases.
5. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**:
    
    - Syntax and use cases for self-executing functions.
6. **Function Parameters**:
    
    - Differentiating between parameters and arguments.
    - Concepts of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
    - Using default parameters for safer function calls.
    - Understanding and using the `arguments` object.
    - Using rest parameters to handle an indefinite number of arguments.
7. **Passing Functions as Arguments (Callbacks)**:
    
    - Creating higher-order functions that accept other functions as arguments.
    - Common use cases, like asynchronous programming with `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
8. **Function Scope and Closures**:
    
    - How variable scope works in JavaScript.
    - Understanding closures and how inner functions retain access to outer variables.
9. **The `this` Keyword**:
    
    - How `this` behaves in different contexts (global, function, and method).
    - Differences in `this` behavior in arrow functions.
    - Using `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` to control `this`.
