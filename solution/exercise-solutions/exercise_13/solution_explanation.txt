Explanation:

In the global context, `this` refers to the global object (`window` object in browsers).

Inside an object method, `this` refers to the object itself when 
the method is called as obj.getValue().

In a regular function, `this` defaults to the global object in 
non-strict mode and undefined in strict mode.
